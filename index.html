            <p>there is two types of moters in a dirt bike the is a two stroke, and a four stroke.
            a two stroke is faster and has a little more power. A 4 stroke has 4 gears and is better 
          for going up hills. It also is fast but only in 3rd and 4th gear 2 gear is for going up a hill and 1st is to do wheelies.</p>
